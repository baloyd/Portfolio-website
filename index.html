              ~ Hello! My name is Daniel Baloy, I'm 33 years old and I'm currently taking a coding bootcamp to pivot my career path into the tech industry. Previously, I went to Barry University where I earned my BFA in Photography with a specialization in Digital Imaging. While I am well versed in the entirety of the Adobe Suite, Photoshop has always been my specialty. After graduation, I had a couple of gallery shows but started retail as a way to pay back my student loans. Retail gave me an opportunity to use the design skills I had gained to create really beautiful shopping experiences.</br>
              8 years would go by with the future of retail hanging in the balance until eventually the pandemic would bring everything crashing down. The coronavirus was the last nail in the coffin for retail as far as I was concerned and decided to persue other avenues. I have always had a healthy fascination with technology and thought about computer science while I was still in high school but ultimately decided against it out of self-doubt and fear. However, as I've grown, so has my confidence, work ethic and sheer determination to make things work for me on my terms. So now here I am, gaining the knowledge and tools I need to finally bring myself to the path that I should have been on from the beginning. Cheers~
